\leveldown{Maxwell speed distribution - pg. 11}

\leveldown{Problem}

Maxwell's derivation of the velocity distribution in a gas was based on the assumptions that it could only depend on the speed $\left \lvert v \right \rvert$, and that the cartesian components are statistically independent.
Show that this leads to Maxwell's law.
